## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://u-elements.github.io/u-elements/) and have searched for existing [Issues](https://github.com/u-elements/u-elements/issues). In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/u-elements/u-elements/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting issues and enhancement suggestions

A good issue shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to describe the issue in detail. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any issues bug as fast as possible:

- See if others have reported the same [issue](https://github.com/u-elements/u-elements/issues).
- Read the [documentation](https://u-elements.github.io/u-elements/) and find out if the functionality or bug is already covered.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.
- If you're experiencing a bug: make sure that you are using the latest version and determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions.

### Submitting an issue:

- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.We use GitHub issues to track issues:
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue or enhancment idea. This usually includes your code.
- If you're experiencing a bug, collect information about the issue:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?
